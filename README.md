[14. Turn an Image into a Link](#problem_014)

# Questions

1. ### problem_013

>
Sometimes you want to add ```a``` elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using ```JavaScript```, which we'll learn about later.

>
The current value of the ```href``` attribute is a link that points to ```"https://freecatphotoapp.com```". Replace the href attribute value with a ```#```, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.

>
Example 

```html
<href = "#"
```
